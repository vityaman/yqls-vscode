# YQLs VSCode Extension

The extension provides a support for the YQLs query language, known for its usage in systems such as [YDB](https://ydb.tech/) and [YTsaurus](https://ytsaurus.tech/). While the SQL-like [YQL](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/yql/reference/) is often used by clients to work with these systems, YQLs is a low-level alternative and an intermediate query representation for type annotation, optimization, compilation and execution.
